## 
🌐 e-GovernmentOS is an open-source chromium fork that runs AI agents natively. **Your open-source, privacy-first alternative to ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet, Dia**.

🔒 Privacy first - use your own API keys or run local models with Ollama. Your data stays on your computer.

💡 Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/YKwjt5vuKr) or [Slack](https://dub.sh/e-governmentos-slack) and help us build! Have feature requests? [Suggest here](https://github.com/e-governmentos-ai/e-GovernmentOS/issues/99).

## Quick start

1. Download and install e-GovernmentOS:
   - [macOS](https://files.e-governmentos.com/download/e-GovernmentOS.dmg)
   - [Windows](https://files.e-governmentos.com/download/e-GovernmentOS_installer.exe)
   - [Linux (AppImage)](https://files.e-governmentos.com/download/e-GovernmentOS.AppImage)
   - [Linux (Debian)](https://cdn.e-governmentos.com/download/e-GovernmentOS.deb)

2. Import your Chrome data (optional)

3. Connect your AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models via Ollama/LMStudio)

4. Start automating!

## What makes e-GovernmentOS special
- 🏠 Feels like home - same familiar interface as Google Chrome, works with all your extensions
- 🤖 AI agents that run on YOUR browser, not in the cloud
- 🔒 Privacy first - bring your own keys or use local models with Ollama. Your browsing history stays on your computer
- 🚀 Open source and community driven - see exactly what's happening under the hood
- 🤝 e-GovernmentOS as MCP server - you can install our MCP server and use the browser from within `claude-code` or `gemini-cli`.
- 🛡️ (coming soon) Built-in AI ad blocker that works across more scenarios!

## Why We're Building e-GovernmentOS

For the first time since Netscape pioneered the web in 1994, AI gives us the chance to completely reimagine the browser. We've seen tools like Cursor deliver 10x productivity gains for developers—yet everyday browsing remains frustratingly archaic.

You're likely juggling 70+ tabs, battling your browser instead of having it assist you. Routine tasks, like ordering something from amazon or filling a form should be handled seamlessly by AI agents.

At e-GovernmentOS, we're convinced that AI should empower you by automating tasks locally and securely—keeping your data private. We are building the best browser for this future!

## How we compare

<details>
<summary><b>vs Chrome</b></summary>
<br>
While we're grateful for Google open-sourcing Chromium, but Chrome hasn't evolved much in 10 years. No AI features, no automation, no MCP support.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs Brave</b></summary>
<br>
We love what Brave started, but they've spread themselves too thin with crypto, search, VPNs. We're laser-focused on AI-powered browsing.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs Arc/Dia</b></summary>
<br>
Many loved Arc, but it was closed source. When they abandoned users, there was no recourse. We're 100% open source - fork it anytime!
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs Perplexity Comet</b></summary>
<br>
They're a search/ad company. Your browser history becomes their product. We keep everything local.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>vs ChatGPT Atlas</b></summary>
<br>
Your browsing data could be used for ads or to train their models. We keep your history and agent interactions strictly local.
</details>
